## Project Overview

The **SSD Yield Optimization Tool** is a Python-based project designed to analyze SSD manufacturing data, identify process inefficiencies, and provide optimization strategies for improving yield, reducing costs, and ensuring quality. This tool integrates statistical methods, including Six Sigma analysis and control charts, to help in understanding defect trends and optimizing the manufacturing process for SSDs and embedded Flash products.

## Features

- **Six Sigma Analysis**: Implements Six Sigma principles to track defect rates, measure yield, and suggest process improvements.
- **Visualizations**: Provides control charts and scatter plots to visualize manufacturing defect trends, cost per unit, and yield percentages.
- **Cost Optimization**: Analyzes the relationship between manufacturing costs and yield to suggest cost-saving measures.
- **Predictive Insights**: Suggests actionable strategies for optimizing manufacturing yield and quality.

## How It Works

This tool simulates SSD manufacturing batches, tracking defect rates and yields over time. It analyzes the data using Six Sigma methodologies to identify potential areas for improvement. The tool generates detailed visualizations that help to pinpoint inefficiencies in the manufacturing process and suggest ways to improve yield while reducing costs.

### Visualizations

- **Defect Rate Control Chart**: Visualizes the defect rate over multiple production batches to identify any trends or outliers.
- **Yield vs. Cost Scatter Plot**: Shows the relationship between the cost per batch and the corresponding yield, highlighting areas for optimization.

## Prerequisites

To run this project, ensure you have Python installed and the following libraries:

```bash
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn
